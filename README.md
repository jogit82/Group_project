Explanations of the technologies used:

Ruby on Rails for backend and database
JQuery for layout and styling of JavaScript
Bootstrap for frontend styling and responsiveness

A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took:

First we wanted to figure out an app that we all wanted to create and could identify with. Then we assigned roles, which were flexible and changed throughout the project. After that we figured out what we wanted to do with our app and what was realistic in the timeframe. Next came the wireframes, and whiteboard. Trello was them implemented and tasks given.

We set up the github repo, then created a rails app. Backend was then set up, followed by routes, and styling. As problems arose we all would offer info on how to fix the issue. Then the web app and design and features changed and evolved as the project went on.

Link to your user stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?

As a user, I want to search drink recipes so that I can create and share drinks with friends.

As a user, I want to be able to save my favorite drinks so I can reference drinks I like.

As a user, I want to be able to see how drinks are made if I have trouble with the recipe so I can make the drink properly. 

As a user, I want to be able to add comments to a drink, so I can share/give input with other users.

Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome

-Using a template caused us the most problems with creating our own styling. It forced us to use !important tags.
-Routes and relationships as the app grew and changed.
-Github and merging and making sure the group staying up to date.
-Our individual deadlines were a hurdle.
-Making sure we weren't working on the same page before pushing.
